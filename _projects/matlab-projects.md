MATLAB projects I worked on using the IRIS Macroeconomic Toolbox.

## List of Projects
- [Canadian Macroeconomic Forecasting](#Cdn-Macro-Forecast)
- [Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model](#var)

### Canadian Macroeconomic Forecasting <a name="Cdn-Macro-Forecast"></a>
This is a project I worked on during the summer of 2020. The goal of the project is to create a forecast of the Canadian Economy by estimating a simple Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model.

### Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model <a name="var"></a>
*This project is forthcoming*
