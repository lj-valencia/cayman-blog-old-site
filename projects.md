# Python for Economics
This is a set of introductory examples on how to apply Python to economic modelling. I do not fully discuss the nuances of the models and appropriate programming practices/conventions in these examples. 

### List of Models:
- [(1) Simple Malthusian Model](https://github.com/lj-valencia/Python-for-Economics/blob/master/Malthusian%20Model.ipynb)
- [(2) The Representative Consumer](https://github.com/lj-valencia/Python-for-Economics/blob/master/One-Period%20Macroeconomic%20Model%20-%20The%20Representative%20Consumer.ipynb)
  - [(2.1) The Representative Consumer: Scenarios and the Labour Supply Curve](https://github.com/lj-valencia/Python-for-Economics/blob/master/One-Period%20Macroeconomic%20Model%20-%20Scenarios%20and%20Labour%20Supply%20Curve.ipynb)
- [(3) The Representative Firm](https://github.com/lj-valencia/Python-for-Economics/blob/master/One-Period%20Macroeconomic%20Model%20-%20The%20Representative%20Firm.ipynb)

# MATLAB
Projects I worked on using MATLAB involve the IRIS macroeconomic modelling toolbox.

### Canadian Macroeconomic Forecasting 
This is a project I worked on during the summer of 2020. The goal of the project is to create a forecast of the Canadian Economy by estimating a simple Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model.

# R-related Projects

### Time-Series Forecasting using Autoregressive LASSO
This project demonstrates how to estimate an autoregressive LASSO using a lagged data-set and use this estimated model for forecasting. To see the files, 
[click here](https://github.com/lj-valencia/R-projects/tree/master/Autoregressive-LASSO).

### Data Retrieval using the cansim package
This project shows how to retrieve data from CANSIM using the cansim package. Vector coordinates are used through the cansim package to retrieve data. To see the files, [click here](https://github.com/lj-valencia/R-projects/tree/master/CANSIM-Retrieval).

### Extracting data from PDF files using the pdftools package
This project shows how to extract data from pdf files using the pdftools package. To see the files, [click here](https://github.com/lj-valencia/R-projects/tree/master/Extract-PDF-1).
