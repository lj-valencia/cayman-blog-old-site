[pythonforecon.html](#Python-for-Economics)
This project contains a set of examples that demonstrate Python applications to economic modelling.

[](# MATLAB Projects)
Projects I worked on using MATLAB involve the IRIS macroeconomic modelling toolbox.

### Canadian Macroeconomic Forecasting 
This is a project I worked on during the summer of 2020. The goal of the project is to create a forecast of the Canadian Economy by estimating a simple Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model.

# R-related Projects

### Time-Series Forecasting using Autoregressive LASSO
This project demonstrates how to estimate an autoregressive LASSO using a lagged data-set and use this estimated model for forecasting. To see the files,

### Data Retrieval using the cansim package
This project shows how to retrieve data from CANSIM using the cansim package. Vector coordinates are used through the cansim package to retrieve data. To see the files, [click here](https://github.com/lj-valencia/R-projects/tree/master/CANSIM-Retrieval).

### Extracting data from PDF files using the pdftools package
This project shows how to extract data from pdf files using the pdftools package. To see the files, [click here](https://github.com/lj-valencia/R-projects/tree/master/Extract-PDF-1).
