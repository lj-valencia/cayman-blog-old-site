This page contains links to projects I have worked using Python, R, and MATLAB.

# Python for Economics
This is a set of introductory examples on how to apply Python to economic modelling. I do not fully discuss the nuances of the models and appropriate programming practices/conventions in these examples. 

### List of Models
[Malthusian Growth Model](https://github.com/lj-valencia/Python-for-Macroeconomics/blob/master/Malthusian%20Model.ipynb)

# MATLAB
This contains a set of projects I worked on using MATLAB and the IRIS macroeconomic modelling toolbox.

### Canadian Macroeconomic Forecasting 
This is a project I worked on during the summer of 2020. In this project, I produced a forecast of the Canadian Economy by estimating a simple Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model. 

[NKPC Model](https://github.com/lj-valencia/MATLAB-Projects/tree/master/NKPC%20Model)

### Vector Autoregression Model
This project contains MATLAB code for a simple Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model of the Canadian Economy.

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and it was inspired by [the /now movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). If you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.
