I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) with a major in Economics and a minor in Political Science at the University of Alberta. My research interests focus on Political Economy, Macroeconomics, and Data Science. 

I currently work as a Junior Economist at the Government of Canada, Western Economic Diversification (WD) where I apply economics and data science in fostering data-driven public policy. I am also an avid programmer. My programming knowledge is mostly on Python, R, MATLAB, LaTeX, and STATA.

I grew up in the Philippines and currently reside in Edmonton, AB, Canada.
