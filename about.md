I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) with a major in Economics and a minor in Political Science at the University of Alberta. My research interests focus on Political Economy, Macroeconomics, and Data Science. 

I currently work as a Junior Economist at [Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD)](https://www.wd-deo.gc.ca/eng/home.asp) where I apply economics and data science in fostering data-driven public policy. I am also an avid programmer. I write code in Python, R, MATLAB, and LaTeX. I also have limited knowledge of STATA. 

I grew up in the Philippines and currently reside in Edmonton, AB, Canada.
