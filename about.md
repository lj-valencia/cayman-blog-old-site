I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) with a major in Economics and a minor in Political Science at the University of Alberta. My research interests focus on political economy, macroeconomics, and data science. 

Shortly after graduating at the University of Alberta, I joined [Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD)](https://www.wd-deo.gc.ca/eng/home.asp) as a Junior Economist where 
I apply economics and data science in developing evidence-driven public policy. 

I am an avid programmer. I write code in Python, R, MATLAB, and LaTeX. I have some knowledge and training in STATA as well. 

I grew up in the Philippines and currently reside in Edmonton, AB, Canada.
