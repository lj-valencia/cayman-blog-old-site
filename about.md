# About me
I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) with a major in Economics and a minor in Political Science at the University of Alberta. My research interests focus on political economy, macroeconomics, data science, and computational economics. 

Shortly after graduating at the University of Alberta, I joined [Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD)](https://www.wd-deo.gc.ca/eng/home.asp) as a Junior Economist.
