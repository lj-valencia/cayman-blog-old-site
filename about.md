I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) with a major in Economics and a minor in Political Science at the University of Alberta. My research interests focus on Macroeconomics, Political Economy, and Data Science. I am also passionate about applying data science and economic analysis to foster evidence-based policy development. I currently work as a Junior Economist at the Government of Canada, Western Economic Diversification (WD). 

I am a casual PC gamer, I frequently discuss politics with my friends, I sing choral music, and I am a huge fan of Basketball and Tennis. I am also an avid programmer. My programming knowledge is mostly on Python, R, MATLAB, and LaTeX. I am also familiar with STATA.

I grew up in the Philippines and currently reside in Edmonton, AB, Canada.
