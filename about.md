I currently work as a Junior Economist at the Government of Canada, Western Economic Diversification (WD). I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) with a major in Economics and a minor in Political Science at the University of Alberta. My research interests are mostly focused on Macroeconomics and Political Economy. I am a firm believer in applying data science to economic analysis and policy formulation.

I am a casual PC gamer, I frequently discuss politics with my friends, I am a passionate singer choral music, and I am a huge fan of Basketball and Tennis. I'm also an avid programmer. My programming knowledge revolves around Python, R and MATLAB. 

I grew up in the Philippines and currently reside in Edmonton, AB, Canada.
