I am a Junior Economist currently working at the Government of Canada, Western Economic Diversification Canada (WD). I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Honors) with a major in Economics and a minor in Political Science at the University of Alberta. My research interests are mostly focused on Macroeconomics and Political Economy. I am also very passionate about applying data science methods to economic analysis. 

I am a casual PC gamer, I frequently discuss politics with my friends, I sing a lot of choral music, and I am also a Basketball and Tennis fan. I'm also an avid programmer, my programming knowledge revolves around Python, R and MATLAB.

I originally grew up in the Philippines and currently reside in Edmonton.
