## About the website <a name="About-Website"></a>
This is my personal website, built using the [Cayman Blog theme](https://github.com/lorepirri/cayman-blog) by Lorenzo Pirritano. I've made modifications on the original Cayman Blog theme to suit my personal preferences. These modifications include:
* A customized footer which includes a LinkedIn logo and copyright statement.
* A profile image for the 'About Me' section of the website.
* The 'Contact Me' page that is present on the original theme is removed.
